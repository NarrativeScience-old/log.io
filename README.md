## So what has changed with this forked version?

UI changes only.

- Additional search filters and highlight matches so that when I search for certain keywords like 401, 404 or 500 errors I can differentiate clearly.

- Added an option to turn off and on the scrolling so that when I'm reviewing the logs it, I wont lose focus to the line that I'm checking.

- Auto warn, remove or manually remove older logs in the screen so that the application won't slow down if it has rendered too many logs already in the browser.

- Row over highlight on logs.

Log.io - Real-time log monitoring in your browser
=================================================

Powered by [node.js](http://nodejs.org) + [socket.io](http://socket.io)

## How does it work?

*Harvesters* watch log files for changes, send new log messages to the *server* via TCP, which broadcasts to *web clients* via socket.io.

Log streams are defined by mapping file paths to a stream name in harvester configuration.

Users browse streams and nodes in the web UI, and activate (stream, node) pairs to view and search log messages in screen widgets.

## Install Server & Harvester

1) Install via npm

    npm install -g log.io --user "ubuntu"

2) Run server

    log.io-server

3) Configure harvester

    nano ~/.log.io/harvester.conf

4) Run harvester

    log.io-harvester

5) Browse to http://localhost:28778

## Server TCP Interface

Harvesters connect to the server via TCP, and write properly formatted strings to the socket.  Third party harvesters can send messages to the server using the following commands:

Send a log message

    +log|my_stream|my_node|info|this is log message\r\n

Register a new node

    +node|my_node\r\n

Register a new node, with stream associations

    +node|my_node|my_stream1,my_stream2\r\n

Remove a node

    -node|my_node\r\n
